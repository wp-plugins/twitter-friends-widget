Displays your Twitter friends with their profile images in the sidebar.

== Description ==

Twitter Friends is a WordPress plugin that displays your Twitter friends/ followers in your sidebar in the same way that they appear on your Twitter homepage.

== Installation ==

1. Extract "twitter-friends-widget.zip".
1. Upload the "twitter-friends-widget" folder to your WordPress plugins directory.
1. Activate the "Twitter Friends Widget" from the WordPress plugins Admin Panel.
1. Update the options, from the Widgets Settings Page under Twitter Friends on the Main Menu.

= Using Twitter Friends Shortcode =

Twitter Friends now includes a WordPress shortcode that allows you to display your friends list in a post/ page. To use the shortcode, create a new post/ page and enter the  Twitter Friends shortcode. The shortcode uses the following syntax:

[twitter-friends title="My Twitter Friends" limit="20" type="friends" size="mini"]

The shortcode takes four attributes:
1. title: The title displayed by the shortcode output. The default is "My Twitter Friends".
1. limit: The number of Twitter Friends to display. Default is 20;
1. type: Display "friends" or "followers". Default is "friends";
1. size: Image size to display - "mini", "normal" or "bigger". Default is "mini".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The profile images are not being displayed =
Twitter stores profile images using Amazon's S3 online storage. The plugin hotlinks to the images on the Amazon. If the Twitter User changes their profile image it may take some time for the cache to update with the latest profile image.

= I have a million followers on Twitter and it takes for ever for my sidebar to load. =
Of course it will. That's why there's an option within the plugin to limit the number of friends that are displayed. Use it.

= Why doesn't the cache update exactly after x seconds? =
The plugin will only check if it needs to be updated when the page displaying the plugin is loaded. So if you set the update interval to 3600 seonds, it will update the cache the next time the page is loaded after that hour has passed.
